## ❓ What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of **protecting systems, networks, and programs** from digital attacks.  
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at:

- 📥 Accessing sensitive information  
- ✏️ Altering or destroying critical data  
- 💰 Stealing money or credentials  
- 🛑 Interrupting normal business operations

---

## 🧩 Breaking Down the Term:
- **Cyber**: Refers to anything related to computers, networks, or the digital world 🌐  
- **Security**: Means protection from harm or unauthorized access 🔐

---

## 🔧 What Do We Do in Cybersecurity?

- 🛡️ **Protect Data** – Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad)  
- 📡 **Monitor Networks** – Constantly observe traffic for suspicious activities  
- 🧱 **Implement Security Measures** – Firewalls, antivirus, encryption, etc.  
- ⚠️ **Conduct Risk Assessments** – Identify and mitigate potential threats  
- 🚨 **Incident Response** – React quickly when breaches occur  
- 🧠 **Educate and Train** – Raise awareness and prevent human error  
- 🔄 **Stay Updated** – Keep up with emerging threats and tools

## ⚠️ Network Anomaly

A **network anomaly** refers to any unusual pattern or behavior in network traffic that could indicate a cyber threat. Detecting anomalies is crucial in **intrusion detection systems (IDS)**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Cybersecurity Teams

### 🔴 RED TEAM – Offensive Security
Focuses on simulating real-world attacks to find security gaps:
- 💣 Ethical Hacking  
- 🕳️ Exploiting Vulnerabilities  
- 🧪 Penetration Testing (Pentesting)  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Black Box Testing  
- 🎭 Social Engineering  
- 🌐 Web App Scanning  

---

### 🟣 PURPLE TEAM – Collaborative Security
Acts as a **bridge between Red and Blue Teams**:
- 🤝 Facilitates improvements in detections & defenses  
- 🧠 Enhances skills of both Red & Blue Team members  
- 🏢 Ideal for large organizations to spot-check systems  

---

### 🔵 BLUE TEAM – Defensive Security
Defends the organization’s systems from attacks:
- 🏰 Infrastructure Protection  
- 🛠️ Damage Control & Containment  
- 🚨 Incident Response (IR)  
- 🔐 Operational Security (OpSec)  
- 🕵️ Threat Hunting  
- 🧬 Digital Forensics

## 💥 Common Cybersecurity Threats

| Threat | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎣 **Phishing** | Tricking users into giving away sensitive info via fake emails/websites |
| 🦠 **Malware** | Malicious software like viruses, worms, and trojans |
| 💰 **Ransomware** | Locks or encrypts files, demanding ransom to restore access <br> _Example: WannaCry_ |
| 👥 **Social Engineering** | Manipulating people into revealing confidential info |
| 🕴️ **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)** | Intercepting communication between two parties |
| 🕳️ **Zero-Day Attack** | Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities before they're patched |

## 🔎 Self-Research Topics

- 🛠️ **VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)**  
  A combination of security testing techniques:  
  - **VA** identifies known vulnerabilities  
  - **PT** simulates real-world attacks to exploit those vulnerabilities

- 🔐 **DevSecOps (Development + Security + Operations)**  
  Integrates security into every stage of the DevOps lifecycle, ensuring secure code from the beginning and throughout deployment.

- 🎮 **Cyber Range Developer**  
  Designs and builds virtual environments to simulate cyberattacks for training, testing, and research purposes.

- 📁 **.json File (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
  A lightweight data-interchange format used for APIs, configurations, and storing structured data. Easy for both humans and machines to read and write.

- 🛡️ **SOC (Security Operations Center)**  
  A centralized team or facility responsible for continuously monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in real time.

- 📂 **/var/log Directory (Linux)**  
  This directory stores system logs in Linux-based systems. It's crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and monitoring suspicious activities.

- 🎮 **C2 (Command and Control)**  
  Refers to infrastructure used by attackers to communicate with compromised devices (bots/malware) and issue commands or exfiltrate data.

- 🧪 **POC (Proof of Concept)**  
  A demonstration showing that a specific vulnerability or attack vector is exploitable — often used to validate the existence and impact of a bug.
